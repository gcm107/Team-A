Business background 
Financial markets generate large volumes of time-stamped 
data that can be used to analyze past behavior and predict future 
rice movements. This project to analyze stock price behavior using 
autoencoder-based regime detection, identify micro-patterns that traditional 
models miss, and evaluate whether transitions between regimes can predict 
short-term future returns or volatility. We use small auto encoder to learn 
regime from 20 days sliding window of price and volume to forecast micro 
regimes changes in the market.

Phases (Data Preparation), Modeling, Clustering, Regime analysis, Predictive Evaluation and Reporting 

#Data Preparation 
Load parquet file 
Create sliding 20-day windows 
Engineer features (returns, rolling vol, log-volume) 

#Modeling 
Build compressed autoencoder (e.g., 20→8→3→8→20) 
Tune hyperparameters 
Extract latent dimension 

#Clustering & Regime Analysis 
Apply K-means on latent space 
Label regimes 
Generate transition matrix 
Predictive Evaluation 

Analyze: 
Does Regime N → Regime M predict tomorrow’s return/volatility? 
Compare to baseline (simple momentum model) 

#Reporting 
Charts: loss curves, cluster visualization, transition matrix 
Insights & recommendations 
Final presentation deck 

#Software Architecture
This project implements a data driven system to attempt to learn micro-regimes
in financial markets using a deep learning pipeline. Our pipeline takes raw 
historical OHLCV stock data and transforms it into fixed-length sequences.
